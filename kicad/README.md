# Board

This directory contains the [Kicad](https://kicad.org) files for a circuit board I've designed for the trackball. This is intended to take the place of the breadboard in a more permanent build.<br>

This design uses the [Seeeduino XIAO Kicad library](https://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2020/04/23/use-seeeduino-xiao-in-kicad-pcb-design-like-a-components/), so if you want to open/modify it with Kicad you probably need to install that first.<br>

This is my first attempt at designing something with Kicad, and I really have no idea what I'm doing. I've had an initial batch of them made by [OshPark](https://oshpark.com), but I haven't actually tested them out yet, so caveat emptor, etc, etc.<br>

I also haven't yet modified the OpenSCAD files for the trackball body to have an option that will make these fit properly. I'm working on that as time allows.<br>

That being said, if you want some of these made for yourself, you can order them 3 at a time [here](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/D077qVES).<br>
